# Snap Hugs
Final Project for Snap Academies 2022: Racial Justice

Our team found that programs for BIPOC success are out there, but connecting youth with the relevant organizations is difficult, and organizations often struggle to drive the content home.

We asked ourselves, how might we help 16-24 year old BIPOC expand their idea of who they can be?

Our Answer is simple.

Introducing Snap Hugs, community pages where BIPOC youth can learn from other People of Color, get involved with nonprofits and companies, and immerse themselves in success.

By embracing ideas, role models, and resources for youth on Snapchat, we are evening the playing field and empowering disenfranchised communities.
